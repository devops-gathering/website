## Sponsoring DevOps Gathering
We are hosting a self organized and non-profit conference providing a platform for the DevOps Community and the DevOps revolution. We like to bring together all of you together: students, developers, CTOs and experts to discuss the hot topics Docker, Kubernetes, Microservices, Clouds and everything else regarding DevOps. Let's share the best practices, the know how and learn from those who know best!

Join the DevOps Gathering and help bringing DevOps friends and communities together! :-)

We offer Gold, Silver, Bronze, Video, Coffee and Party Night sponsor packages. If you have other ideas how you want to sponsor the event, please get in touch with us. We are happy to create a new sponsor package just for you.
