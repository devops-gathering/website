Window Server 2016 brings Docker and Windows containers built-in. Letâ€™s adopt this new way to deploy applications on Windows. You will learn how to unify your deployment for both Linux and Windows platforms.

With Docker we have learned how to build and run applications in Linux containers. But what if you also have tasks that can run only on Windows machines?

With Windows Server 2016 you can use Docker and Windows Containers to have the same experience and workflow.

In this talk you will learn how to release your application both as Linux and Windows container and deploy them as multiarch Docker image.

## Key takeaways:

* Learn how to build and release an application with GitHub
* Build a Linux application with Travis CI
* Build a Windows application with AppVeyor CI
* Push both platform specific Docker images
* Draft a multiarch Docker image
* Push your images to Docker Hub
