The DevOps movement is gaining momentum - which is good. But still DevOps often is seen way to small. DevOps is not only a bit more collaboration between Development and Operations or just the introduction of some new tools and technologies. Instead, DevOps is the implementation driver for a massive change in IT - and it is not enough in itself.

In this keynote we will examine the drivers and goals behind DevOps, why we need the change, how DevOps affects the whole IT value chain and what else is needed to really "become DevOps". We will develop a DevOps ecosystem and draw the missing lines between several important concepts that all feed into the goals behind DevOps.
