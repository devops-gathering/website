ShuttleCloud is a small startup specialized in migrating email and contacts at scale, proud of having Google among its customers. We migrated our primitive monitoring to Prometheus one year ago and the switch have proved being cost-effective.

In this talk I'll present our monitoring infrastructure, the instrumentation and operational challenges we have faced and some good/bad monitoring patterns we've learned down the road.


## Key takeaways:

* Learn monitoring patterns 
* Leanrn about the instrumentation of Prometheus
