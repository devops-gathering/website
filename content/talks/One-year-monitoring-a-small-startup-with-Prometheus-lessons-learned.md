ShuttleCloud is a small startup specialized in migrating email and contacts at scale, proud of having Google among its customers. We migrated our primitive monitoring to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) one year ago and the switch have proved being cost-effective.

In this talk I'll present our monitoring infrastructure, the instrumentation and operational challenges we have faced and some good/bad monitoring patterns we've learned down the road.


## Key takeaways:

* Learn monitoring patterns
* Learn about the instrumentation of prometheus
* Learn how to scale prometheus
