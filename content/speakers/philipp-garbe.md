Philipp works as Lead Software Developer at AutoScout24 in Munich. Since more than 7 years he's working with web technologies and at the moment he's part of "Tatsu" the project that transforms the matured AutoScout24 IT setup into a nextgen Web-Scale IT platform. As Docker Captain he shares his knowledge and experience about Containers.

Philipp is driven by technologies and tools that allows him to release faster and more often. He expects that every commit automatically goes into production and it shouldn't surprise that he's excited about microservices, docker and the cloud. Affected by Pain Driven Development, he believes that things need to be changed whenever the pain is big enough.
