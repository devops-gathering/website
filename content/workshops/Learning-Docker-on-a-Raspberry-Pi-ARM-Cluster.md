Using containers to develop, test and run applications is well known for cloud and datacenter environments. Since last year Docker is also officially available for a wide range of ARM devices. In this hands-on workshop we're going to introduce you to the principles and specific requirements of using Docker on a low-cost ARM cluster. Step by step we're looking into the details on how to install Docker in no time and run your first microservice application with Docker Compose. Later on we're digging even deeper into the specific requirements for containerized IoT applications to build resource constraint containers and optimizing containers for minimal size.

Docker can run and orchestrate your applications very efficiently, even on the smallest devices. Step into a new dimension when using Docker on low-powered ARM devices which breaks all limits and discover and resolve bottlenecks easily before they hit you in production. Scale down to the bare minimum, speed it up and get ready for a truly massive scale. Let’s start using Docker in your complete software stack to interconnect the Cloud and the future with Billions of IoT devices.

In this hands-on workshop we’re going to introduce you to the basic principles of Docker and how the orchestration of container works, even if you have to handle a power or network outage. We'll install Docker on real baremetal hardware sitting on your desk as a multi-node Raspberry Pi cluster. Then deploying a first distributed application and scale it up to a fault-tolerant system and testing it in a chaos monkey fashion with real failures of the compute nodes.

Additionally we'll dig deeper into the specific requirements of using containers for IoT use cases. By iterating through optimization steps for small devices, you will discover which value it even brings to classic container applications. This reveals the details and benefits of a container-based development and runtime environment, which helps to achieve better portability, maintenance and security by isolating the application code from the hardware. We'll try to inspire you to learn and use Docker and containers on ARM devices in a very practical way.


## Key Takeaways

  * Learn how to orchestrate containers with Docker on low-cost baremetal hardware
  * Learn the basic concepts of Docker and building fault-tolerant services
  * Learn building resource constraint containers and optimizing containers for minimal size

## What you will need

  * Basic Docker experience recommended, but not required
  * Bring your own laptop (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  * You'll need a SSH client or Putty to access the ARM cluster
