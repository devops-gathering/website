The rise of container technologies allows us to fundamentally change the way we develop, test and deploy software. However, the problem and solution space with which software developers are confronted nowadays has become even bigger and we - as a profession - still need to discover patterns and practices for successfully dealing with this level of complexity.

Thanks to tools like Docker, spinning up a full-fledged relational database isn’t more difficult or time consuming than using an in-memory database anymore. So why not run your integration tests on your local machine, inside an environment which resembles production as close as possible?

This workshop takes you through the complete development lifecycle of a simple microservice, using familiar tools such as Spring-Boot and Gradle. After that we take a glimpse into the new possibilities, that the container technology give our development and testing environments.

The rise of container technologies allows us to fundamentally change the way we develop, test and deploy software. However, the problem and solution gap by which software developers are confronted nowadays has become even bigger. We - as a profession - still need to discover patterns and practices for successfully dealing with this level of complexity.

Thanks to tools like Docker, spinning up a full-fledged relational database isn’t more difficult or time consuming than using an in-memory database anymore. So why not run your integration tests on your local machine, inside an environment which resembles production as close as possible?

This workshop takes you through the complete development lifecycle of a simple microservice, using familiar tools such as Spring-Boot and Gradle. After that we take a glimpse into the new possibilities, that the container technology give our development and testing environments.

## Agenda:
* Run Spring-Boot Apps inside a Docker container
* Build your Spring-Boot Docker image using Gradle
* Make Spring-Boot Apps configurable with environment variables
* Unit- and Integration-Test your Spring-Boot App with Spock and Docker
* Deploy and configure Spring-Boot microservices using docker-compose
