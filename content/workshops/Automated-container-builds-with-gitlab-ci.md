Whether small startups or large companies - many companies rely on the open-source Docker technology. But what about the kind of containers that roll up the virtualization market and change the software development in the long term? Docker promises a quick start, flexible configuration and stable images for development and production. Nice, but a developer or operator must be setup there automation to build, test and deliver Docker images. At this workshop you learn to setup GitLab/CI to maintain your project sources, automate your Continuous Integration and Delivery pipeline for simple Docker images.

We start with an overview and introduce the first steps with the use of GitLab/CI. You will get an overview of the most important components, instructions and concepts. Using a simple example, you will learn how to implement a microservice, automate the build with a simple gitlab runner, install with Docker, test and integrate with other services in an environment.


## Key Takeaways

  * Learn how to simple setup GitLab/CI
  * Learn the basic concepts of build docker images with GitLab/CI
  * Learn setup a simple microservice test pipeline

## What you will need

  * Basic Docker experience recommended
  * Bring your own laptop (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  * You'll need a SSH client or Putty to access the cloud instance
